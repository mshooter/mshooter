## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! This is a collection of things I build, break, fix, and sometimes finish! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working at **Industrial Light and Magic** as a **R&D Engineer**, where I develop tools and systems at the intersection of **machine learning**, **software engineering**, and **computer graphics**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vietnamese and Spanish, and exploring multi-modal models as part of my ongoing research interests
- 💬 I enjoy chatting about life, research, creative coding, and the future of tech and art.
- **Fun fact**: I came to the U.K. from Belgium to study, and somehow never left. Still blaming the research opportunities (and maybe the scones).
